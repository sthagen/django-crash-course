## Greetings! 

Hello! As a reader, you're encouraged to submit bug reports to us for errors that you find. In turn we will give you credit for your contributions in not just the e-book but also in the print paperback and online publicly on the web. This is your opportunity to have your name in one of our books as a contributor, which you are then welcome to add to your resume and LinkedIn profile. (Note: TODOs are markers to let you know we are going to expand an area, so reporting them during the ALPHA and BETA period **doesn't** qualify as an attributable item.)
